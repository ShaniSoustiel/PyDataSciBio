    "In computer science, concurrency is about managing multiple tasks in a program, while parallelism is about actually executing them simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of concurrency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple tasks: A program is broken down into smaller tasks that can be run independently.\n",
    "- Out-of-order execution: The order in which these tasks are completed isn't necessarily important. As long as the final outcome is correct, it doesn't matter if task B finishes before task A.\n",
    "- Partial order: There might be some dependencies between tasks, requiring a certain level of order. Task B might need the results of task A before it can start.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several benefits to using concurrency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved responsiveness: If a program encounters a long-running task, concurrency allows it to continue working on other tasks while waiting. This makes the program feel more responsive to the user.\n",
    "- Efficient resource utilization: By keeping the processor busy with multiple tasks, concurrency can improve overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, concurrency also introduces challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coordination: When multiple tasks are accessing shared resources, there's a risk of conflicts. Careful coordination is needed to ensure data consistency and prevent issues like deadlocks.\n",
    "- Complexity: Reasoning about concurrent programs can be difficult. The out-of-order execution can lead to unexpected behavior if not managed properly.\n"

So threads are great for concurrency in I/O bounded programs, because as one thread waits for I/O, other threads can go on doing their jobs, as the GIL is released. This is true as long as I/O is not very quick and there are not too many concurrent jobs; if there are many concurrent short jobs, they will start a [GIL war](http://www.dabeaz.com/GIL/), which is bad for performence.\n",

    "\n",
    "**coroutines** are functions that can be suspended and resumed, similar to generators. When doing I/O bounded async programming, coroutines can also become `Future` objects. You can think about them as lightweight threads or green threads: they are scheduled by Python, rather than the operating system, and run in the same thread and process - so not useful for CPU-bounded programs even if releasing the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines are defined using `async def` (or in Python 3.4, using `def` with a special decorator). \n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines can yield the control using the `await` statement (or `yield from` in Python < 3.5) to other coroutines, which lets the scheduler know that this coroutines in now waiting for results from another coroutine. The scheduler then schedules the other coroutine to run. This is in contrast to theads, in which control switches are managed by the operating system (and sometimes prevented by the GIL), which requires us (sometimes) to use locks and semaphors in order to make sure that our data stays \"whole\", and creates risks like GIL wars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Async programming with coroutines can enchance runtime in I/O-bouded programs, and the programmatic overhead is relatively small (as can be seen below). Moreover, coroutines are much cheaper than threads, in terms of their memory footprint, as they all live in a single interperter and thread. Therefore, we can spawn thousands of them, while we cannot afford to spawn thousands of threads."
